* Developp a feature and create a [pull request](https://github.com/suricate-io/suricate/pulls)

## Installation

### Backend application

1. Download and install [maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
2. Run the following commands

```bash
### Under "suricate" folder
## Switch to backend project
$ cd backend

## Create the binary
$ mvn package

## Run project
# Default environment
$ java -jar ./target/monitoring.jar
# Dev environment
$ java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=dev ./target/monitoring.jar
```

### Frontend application

1. Download and install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (this soft allow you to use NPM packages)
2. Run the following commands

```bash
### Under "suricate" folder
## Switch to frontend project
$ cd frontend

## import dependencies
$ npm install

## Run the project
$ npm start
```

The application is accessible on <http://localhost:4200/>  
If you have no access create a new account on the application.

## Configuration

With the default Spring profile the backend

* use an H2 in memory database
* load all widgets from GitHub
* Use Database user access

### Development

In development you can override some configurations :

* Database
* Authentication provider
* Widget folder path

#### 1. Code formatting

Follow the style you see used in the primary repository!  
Consistency with the rest of the project always trumps other considerations. It doesnâ€™t matter if you have your own style or if the rest of the code breaks with the greater community - just follow along.

Don't forget to include licence header in **all** files

```

##### Automatically add the licence with IntelliJ

1. In the Settings/Preferences dialog (Ctrl+Alt+S), click Copyright under Editor, and then click Copyright Profiles. The Copyright Profiles page opens.

2. Click on the **Add Button** :
    * Choose a name : Apache 2
    * Under Copyright text copy/paste the licence text above
    * Then click on **Apply**

3. Then click **Copyright** and select the Apache 2 copright as **Default** and click on Apply.

4. Verify that you have (under Copyright > Formatting) for Java, JavaScript and TypeScript **Use default settings** select.

#### 2. Database

With the default properties an H2-Console is available :

* URL : *<http://localhost:8080/h2-console>*
* Database access : *jdbc:h2:mem:dev;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE*
* Database Username : *sa*
* Database Password :

You can override database properties by uncommenting and filling the following lines (file : resources/application-dev.yml)

```YAML
# datasource:
#   url:
#   driverClassName:
#   username:
#   password:
```

#### 3. Authentication provider

Two types of authentication providers has been implemented : LDAP and DATABASE  
By default authentication is set to DATABASE

You can override these properties by changing *database* to *ldap* in the following lines (file : resources/application-dev.yml) and by uncommenting and filling the ldap properties

``` YAML
### Security (ldap | database) ###
provider: database
###   LDAP Authentication   ###
# ldap:
#  url:
#  userSearchFilter:
#  firstNameAttributName:
#  lastNameAttributName:
#  mailAttributName:
```

#### 4. Widgets Management

In development it could be easier to have the Widget repository in local follow the steps if you want to manage it locally :

1. Clone the repo from GitHub : *[Widget Repository](https://github.com/suricate-io/widgets)*
2. Open the file in backend project located at : *resources/application-dev.yml*
3. Add the Widget Repository path to the following line : *widgets.local.folderPath:*

```YAML
#### Example :
widgets.local.folderPath: C:\\my\\widget\\folder\\path
```

##### Management Rules

When launching the backend with *-Dspring.profiles.active=#env#* argument

1. If *widgets.local.folderPath* in *resources/application-#env#.yml* is not blank, the repository used is the local one
2. Else we get the repository from GitHub
